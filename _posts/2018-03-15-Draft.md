title: OJ Wheels, Spring 2018
---

The wheels I buy are basically an afterthought once I put them on my board. They feel too fresh for a few sessions, a little too big, then they simply feel like wheels. I generally buy the same size and same duro. If there's a deal on a set with some kind of variable, like OJ's "Hard Line," "Blender Shape," or "Easy Ledge," I usually don't put too much thought into the difference because after a few sessions they all kinda feel the same to me.

The wheel buying process, though, is sick. They have immense fondle value, even looking at them on a screen. I love the graphics printed on the wheel fronts. I'll spend more time looking at wheels that don't fit my physical requirements just because they look cool. The wheel itself is a medium with physical limitations for the printed art. With this post, I want to survey what OJ Wheels is doing with wheels in their Spring 2018 catalog that came out on (date).

## **Jon Dickson**

The first wheel is the only one that I don't totally get. I think the Jeffrey Dahmer theme may be because of two reasons:
1. Jon Dickson enjoyed The recent Marc Meyes film, My Friend Dahmer
2. Jon is a psycho

(clip of Jon ollieing that roof)

The wheel features caricatures of Dahmer and Glenn Rodgers (Ed Glen) with fresh blood on their mouths from a tasty meal. The front is black and the art is in reverse. The rest of the wheel is a marbling of fleshy tone. There's a nice touch in the ad with the wheels served up on styrofoam plate like their fresh from the butcher. The wheels are served, and look like, four pieces of meat. These wheels demonstrate what I mean by fondle value. I want to buy these just so I can touch them. They are like little filet mignons.

Unlike Dahmer, Glen Rogers is still alive on Death Row. The Casanova Killer filed an appeal in April 2005 that is still pending, for prosecutorial misconduct. He's still out there in California.

## **Nora Vasconcellos**

The "Cat and Mouse" have a playful yet badass aesthetic that her style of skating does. I think it is because of all the smiling. When I skate, I am fighting with the board to make it do what I want. Anytime I see myself skating on film, I make variations of this awkward kind of grimace. Skaters that look excited to be skating are really fun to watch. It makes you stoked to skate. The happy mouse flipping the bird is emblematic of the feeling I got watching skating before I had done it myself. It's being playfully belligerent. Even the cat doesn't seem to care. It's too bad you can't see the mouse's hand on the wheel.

Need some videos of nora being cool

## **Ben Raybourn**

No extraneous details about the person. It's got the simple Thrasher hat, the recognizable glasses. The sunny, California vibe that I don't understand because I've never been there. I think the mellow energy depicted on the wheel is in contrast with the way Ben Raybourn skates.

The behavior in this video doesn't evoke lackadaisacal, tipsy skating, cruising spots at sunset. I like this kind of contrast, and I think it makes up for the lack of imagination on this wheel as opposed to some of the others. The warm looking art compared to the potentially bone jarring stunts motivates me to want to try stuff. 

<img src="/lisaskates/images/ben1.jpg" alt="ben">

I think the bone jarring aspect is just my perception of what I see in these videos. To him, it's just cruising. It's boosts my confidence, as a skater, to see confidence on display, helping to purge bad ideas when I'm visualizing a trick of my own.

## **Erick Winkowski**

Trippy, liquidy clockwise movement. Some warm, ocean imagery. And mushrooms, which I guess are the big marketing draw for these wheels. I understand that folks identify, to a degree, with the drugs they take, and merchandising that is probably a profitable idea.

Here are some other artists that have found success with merchandising their drug of choice.

Mushrooms:

Weed:

Other:

Drugs go with skateboarding. I wouldn't be the first person to recognize that. I like the psychoactive experience of mushrooms. But tripping is somewhat of a private, special experience, and I think selling something to me based on the *idea* of that to me is kinda weird. It takes something away from the intensity of the experience felt.

I am a hypocrite, though, because I am sold on other wheel art because of the idea of the felt experience that I identify with on the wheels. I might have somewhat of a post-traumautic response to drug imagery in marketing once I realized, as a younger person, that the Grateful Dead all became exceptionally wealthy.

Anyways, Erick Winkowski is fucked.

## **Figgy**

Psychedelic rock, guitar pick included. Different colored wheels is fun. The art on the wheel accurately depicts the primal urge to listen to some classic rock minded riffing, drink some beers, and try a stunt. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKQGC5kowSE?start=7" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The psychedelic rock imagery better suits Figgy and his personality. You can tell he is happiest when he's jamming.

I noticed a trend in the color scheme of Figgy's previous wheels.

Does Figgy have a lust for the Joker?

## **Jason Jesse**

"If I was a Cop and Didn't Skate"

<img src="/lisaskates/images/jesse.jpg" alt="jesse">

The sentiment in this one is pretty straightforward. Jason Jesse's wheels tend to slide easily to the edgy side. I guess someone has to keep skateboarding from not trying hard enough in the vanguard of counter culture.

Case in point:

## **Carsone Lee**

https://www.linkedin.com/in/carsonmlee/ 

The team manager/videographer/video editor for Enjoi for the last two years. Carson Lee has an impressive resume as a freelance videographer/video editor, and was a cinematographer for Transworld for several years. 

A caricature of the filmer flying blissfully through the clouds on Falcor’s back, lifting the camera in exaltation. 

<img src="/lisaskates/images/carson1.jpg" alt="carson">

Good on OJ. If you’re going to use someone’s likeness to sell your product, then to use Carson Lee’s is giving credit where it is due. Filmers skate as much as the skaters being filmed.

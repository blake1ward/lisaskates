title: OJ Wheels, Spring 2018
---

The wheels I buy are basically an afterthought once I put them on my board. They feel too fresh for a few sessions, a little too big, then they simply feel like wheels. I generally buy the same size and same duro. If there's a deal on a set with some kind of variable, like OJ's Hard Line<a href="#1" id="11"><sup>1</sup></a>, Universal<a href="#2" id="21"><sup>2</sup></a>, or Easy Ledge<a href="#3" id="31"><sup>3</sup></a>, I usually don't put too much thought into the difference because after a few sessions they all kinda feel the same to me.

The wheel buying process, though, is sick. They have immense fondle value, even looking at them on a screen. I love the graphics printed on the wheel fronts. I'll spend more time looking at wheels that don't fit my physical requirements just because they look cool. 

The wheel itself is a medium with physical limitations for the art that is printed on it. With this post, I want to survey what OJ Wheels is doing with that medium in their Spring 2018 catalog.

## **Jon Dickson**

<img src="/lisaskates/images/jon.jpg" alt="jon">

The first wheel is the only one that I don't totally get conceptually. I think the Jeffrey Dahmer theme may be because of two reasons:
1. Jon Dickson enjoyed The recent Marc Meyes film, My Friend Dahmer<a href="#4" id="41"><sup>4</sup></a>
2. Jon is a psycho

<img src="/lisaskates/images/dicksonflip.jpg" alt="cvs kickflip">

The wheel features caricatures of Dahmer and Glenn Rodgers (Ed Glen) with fresh blood on their mouths from, presumably, a human meal. The front is black and the art is in reverse. The rest of the wheel is a marbling of fleshy tone. There's a nice touch in the ad with the wheels served up on styrofoam plate like their fresh from the butcher. The wheels are served, and look like, four pieces of meat. These wheels demonstrate what I mean by fondle value. I want to buy these just so I can touch them. They are like little filet mignons.

Unlike Dahmer, Glen Rogers is still alive on Death Row. The Casanova Killer filed an appeal in April 2005 that is still pending, for prosecutorial misconduct. He's still out there in California.

## **Nora Vasconcellos**

<img src="/lisaskates/images/nora.jpg" alt="nora">

The "Cat and Mouse" have a playful yet badass aesthetic that Nora Vasconcello's style of skating does. I think it is because of all the smiling. When I skate, I am fighting with the board to make it do what I want. Skaters that look excited to be skating are really fun to watch. It makes you stoked to skate. The happy mouse flipping the bird is emblematic of the feeling I got seeing someone skating before I had done it myself, playful belligerence. Even the cat doesn't seem to care. It's too bad you can't see the mouse's hand on the wheel.

## **Ben Raybourn**

<img src="/lisaskates/images/ben.jpg" alt="ben">

No extraneous details about the person. It's got the simple Thrasher hat, the recognizable glasses, and the sunny, California vibe that I don't understand because I've never been there. I think the mellow energy depicted on the wheel is in contrast with the way Ben Raybourn skates. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZlvKkovx9Gc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The behavior in this video doesn't evoke lackadaisacal, tipsy skating, cruising spots at sunset -- the impression I get from the warm tones on the wheel. The contrast makes up for the lack of imagination on this wheel as opposed to some of the others. The impression of the art compared to the potentially bone jarring stunts motivates me to want to try stuff. 

<img src="/lisaskates/images/ben1.jpg" alt="ben">

The danger aspect is my applied perception to what I see in his videos. To him, it's just cruising. It's boosts my confidence, as a skater, to see confidence on display, helping to purge bad ideas when I'm visualizing a trick of my own.

## **Erick Winkowski**

<img src="/lisaskates/images/erick.jpg" alt="erick">

Trippy, liquidy clockwise movement. Some warm, ocean imagery. And mushrooms, which I guess are the big marketing draw for these wheels. I understand that folks identify, to a degree, with the drugs they take, and merchandising that is probably a profitable idea.

Here are some other artists that have found success with merchandising their drug of choice.

*Mushrooms*:

<img src="/lisaskates/images/allman.jpg" alt="allman">
<img src="/lisaskates/images/gratefuldead.jpg" alt="dead">

*Weed*:

<img src="/lisaskates/images/snoop.jpg" alt="snoop">

*Other*:

<img src="/lisaskates/images/xan.jpg" alt="xan">

Drugs go with skateboarding. I wouldn't be the first person, not even the one hundred thousandth person, to recognize that. I like the psychoactive experience of mushrooms. But tripping is somewhat of a private, special experience, and I think selling something to me based on the *idea* of that to me is kinda weird. It takes something away from the intensity of the felt experience.

I am a hypocrite, though, because I am sold on other wheel art because of the idea of the felt experience that I identify with, that I enjoy or suppose I could enjoy. I have somewhat of a post-traumautic response to drug imagery in marketing once I realized, as a younger person, that the Grateful Dead all became exceptionally wealthy, and it disrupted my notion of the jam band as a more socialist, communal entity.

Anyways, Erick Winkowski is fucked.

## **Figgy**

<img src="/lisaskates/images/fig.jpg" alt="fig">

Psychedelic rock, guitar pick included. Different color wheels is fun. The art on the wheel accurately depicts the primal urge to listen to some classic rock minded riffing, drink some beers, and try a stunt. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKQGC5kowSE?start=7" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The psychedelic rock imagery better suits Figgy and his personality. You can tell he is happiest when he's jamming. 

I noticed a trend in the color scheme of Figgy's previous wheels.

Does Figgy have a lust for the Joker?

## **Jason Jesse**

"If I was a Cop and Didn't Skate"

<img src="/lisaskates/images/jesse.jpg" alt="jesse">

The sentiment in this one is pretty straightforward. Jason Jesse's wheels tend to veer to the edgy side. I guess someone has to keep skateboarding from not trying hard enough in the vanguard of controversial art.

Case in point:

<img src="/lisaskates/images/edgy1.jpg" alt="edgy1">
<img src="/lisaskates/images/edgy2.jpg" alt="edgy2">
<img src="/lisaskates/images/edgy3.jpg" alt="edgy3">

Jason Jessee might be a fan of other controversial works, such as Andres Serrano's <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Piss_Christ_by_Serrano_Andres_%281987%29.jpg/220px-Piss_Christ_by_Serrano_Andres_%281987%29.jpg" target="_blank">Piss Christ (1987)</a>, David Černý's <a href="https://images.curiator.com/image/upload/t_x/art/eac261f54c5166a81e98d7006c1a6325.jpg" target="_blank">Shark (2005)</a>, and Paul McCarthey's <a href="https://s-i.huffpost.com/gen/2191966/images/n-PAUL-MCCARTHY-TREE-628x314.jpg" target="_blank">Tree (2014)</a>.

Maybe he wore his hat <a href="/lisaskates/images/jessehat.jpg" target="_blank">like this one time</a>, recognized it was a hit, so he <a href="http://www.lulaapparel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jasonjessee.png" target="_blank">upped</a> <a href="/lisaskates/images/jesseehat1.jpg" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="http://wizardvarnish.com/wv/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jason-jessee-b7ZcHs1r0g85jo1_400.jpg" target="_blank">ante</a>. That seems to be the style. Push the envelope in a provocative way. Skate aggressively and don't give a fuck if people get pissed, because <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pqMNkZdZPgI/USuZS6hoGwI/AAAAAAAAH4E/7CwfzWdij3M/s1600/XX7F0627.jpg" target="_blank">you don't care</a>. 

<img src="/lisaskates/images/jessehat.jpg" alt="jason jessee">

Piss Christ, however, wasn't intended to be merely an edgy denunciation of Christianity<a href="5x" id="51"><sup>5</sup></a>. These wheels, on the other hand, represent a seemingly adolescent urge to piss on things you don't like. I can't see anything deeper in the wheels' concepts. If you enjoy high testosterone skating and flipping off the man, then these wheels might be for you. The art looks cool, but the concept furthers stereotypes about skaters that I don't think are necessarily all true today.

The team manager/videographer/video editor for Enjoi for the last two years. Carson Lee has an impressive resume<a href="#6" id="61"><sup>6</sup></a> as a freelance videographer/video editor, and was a cinematographer for Transworld for several years. 

A caricature of the filmer flying blissfully through the clouds on Falcor’s back, lifting the camera in exaltation. 

<img src="/lisaskates/images/carson1.jpg" alt="carson">

That's a cool thing for OJ to do. If you’re going to use someone’s likeness to sell your product, then to use Carson Lee’s is giving credit where it is due. Filmers skate as much as the skaters being filmed.

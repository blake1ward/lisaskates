title: OJ Wheels, Spring 2018
---

The wheels I buy are basically an afterthought once I put them on my board. They feel too fresh for a few sessions, a little too big, then they simply feel like wheels. I generally buy the same size and same duro. If there's a deal on a set with some kind of variable, like OJ's "Hard Line," "Blender Shape," or "Easy Ledge," I usually don't put too much thought into the difference because after a few sessions they all kinda feel the same to me.

The wheel buying process, though, is sick. They have immense fondle value, even looking at them on a screen. I love the graphics printed on the wheel fronts. I'll spend more time looking at wheels that don't fit my physical requirements just because they look cool. The wheel itself is a medium with physical limitations for the printed art. With this post, I want to survey what OJ Wheels is doing with wheels in their Spring 2018 catalog that came out on (date).

### **Jon Dickson**

The first wheel is the only one that I don't totally get. I think the Jeffrey Dahmer theme may be because of two reasons:
1. Jon Dickson enjoyed The recent Marc Meyes film, My Friend Dahmer
2. Jon is a psycho

The wheel features caricatures of Dahmer and Glenn Rodgers (Ed Glen) with fresh blood on their mouths from a tasty meal. The front is black and the art is in reverse. The rest of the wheel is a marbling of fleshy tone. There's a nice touch in the ad with the wheels served up on styrofoam plate like their fresh from the butcher. The wheels are served, and look like, four pieces of meat. These wheels demonstrate what I mean by fondle value. I want to buy these just so I can touch them. They are like little filet mignons.

Unlike Dahmer, Glen Rogers is still alive on Death Row. The Casanova Killer filed an appeal in April 2005 that is still pending, for prosecutorial misconduct. He's still out there in California. 

### **Nora Vasconcellos**

The "Cat and Mouse" have a playful yet badass aesthetic that her style of skating does. I think it is because of all the smiling. When I skate, I am fighting with the board to make it do what I want. Anytime I see myself skating on film, I make variations of this awkward kind of grimace. Skaters that look excited to be skating are really fun to watch. It makes you stoked to skate. The happy mouse flipping the bird is emblematic of the feeling I got watching skating before I had done it myself. It's being playfully belligerent. Even the cat doesn't seem to care. It's too bad you can't see the mouse's hand on the wheel.

### **Ben Raybourn**

No extraneous details about the person symbolized by the art on the wheel. No funky, insane style, the simple Thrasher hat. The recognizable glasses. Sunny, good vibes.

### **Erick Winkowski**

### **Figgy**

A lot of his past wheels are purple/green. Does Figgy have a secret lust for the Joker?

### **Jason Jesse**

"If I was a Cop and Didn't Skate"
This one is pretty straightforward and indicative of Jason Jesse's high T style. Take a look at some of the beanie styles. One would not stack layers on top of one's head without being entirely sure of themselves.

His pro model wheels tend to slide easily to the edgy side. Last season’s wheel featured a dog with a gun to its head, and before that, Jesus exhaling a big hit. 

Carsone Lee: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carsonmlee/ 

The team manager/videographer/video editor for Enjoi for the last two years. Carson Lee has an impressive resume as a freelance videographer/video editor, and was a cinematographer for Transworld for several years. 

A caricature of the filmer flying blissfully through the clouds on Falcor’s back, lifting the camera in exaltation. 

Good on OJ. If you’re going to use someone’s likeness to sell your product, then to use Carson Lee’s is giving credit where it is due. Filmers skate as much as the skaters being filmed.
